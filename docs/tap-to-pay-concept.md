## The hardware boundary — read first

The Feitian BioCARD is a JavaCard secure element with a contactless
ISO-14443 interface. It can hold keys, sign, and run small applets. It
**cannot**:

- connect to the internet (no WiFi, no cellular, no Bluetooth),
- display anything (no screen, no LEDs the host can drive),
- accept user input directly (no keypad),
- broadcast a transaction,
- read the Bitcoin mempool,
- open a Lightning channel,
- talk to an Arkade ASP.

That is not a software bug we can fix; it is the hardware. Every hardware
wallet has the same shape — a Ledger signs but your computer broadcasts;
a Trezor signs but your phone broadcasts. The card is the signer, never
the network endpoint.

**Implication for "card alone at a terminal":** the card alone is enough
to *sign*, but it is never enough to *pay*. Paying needs an internet-connected
device that can fetch an invoice, build a transaction, get a signature from
the card, and broadcast. The only question is *whose* device that is:

- **yours** (your phone in your pocket) — Scenario C below, or
- **the merchant's** (a Bitcoin POS terminal at the counter) — Scenario B.

There is no Scenario "card and nothing else." That is physics, not software.

A Boltcard avoids this by being custodial: the card holds no keys, only a
static URL. The terminal reads the URL and the custodian pays. Self-custody
+ card-only + no-internet-device is structurally impossible on every
hardware class that exists today.

---

## Two real scenarios

| | Scenario C (today) | Scenario B (the vision) |
|---|---|---|
| Whose device is involved | your phone (or anyone's phone running our app) | the merchant's POS terminal (running our firmware) |
| Card alone? | no — needs a phone | yes — the terminal is the merchant's, not yours |
| Internet | the phone has it | the terminal has it |
| Buildable today | yes — Android NFC signing and Ark broadcast proven | no — needs a standalone reference terminal implementation |
| "At any POS" | everywhere a phone is | only at merchants running our terminal software |
| Self-custody | yes (card holds the key, phone holds nothing) | yes |

Both scenarios use the **same card** and the **same on-card applets**. The
difference is purely what the other end of the NFC link is.

---

## Scenario C — phone as a dumb terminal (buildable today)

You tap your card to a phone running the Nuri app. The phone is a dumb
terminal: it provides NFC transport, internet, UI, and Lightning plumbing.
It holds **no keys**. The card is the client signer; the Arkade ASP is the
cosigner. No PRF, no derived key in phone RAM. (See
[`docs/signing-architecture.md`](signing-architecture.md) Model A for why
this is simpler and stronger than the PRF path.)

### UX flow

```
┌─────────────┐   NFC (ISO-DEP)    ┌──────────────┐    internet    ┌────────────┐
│   your card │ ←────────────────→ │  phone (app) │ ←────────────→ │  Arkade ASP│
│  (client sk)│                    │  (no keys)   │                │  (ASP sk)  │
└─────────────┘                    └──────────────┘                └────────────┘

1. Tap card → phone reads card MuSig2 pubkey over NFC (no PIN) →
   registers with the ASP → shows your BTC address + balance.
   Read-only, harmless.

2. You (or the merchant) enter a Lightning invoice / amount on the phone.

3. Tap 2 → phone sends CTAP2 clientPin APDU → you type the card PIN on
   the phone → card verifies PIN (card-enforced) → card is now authorized
   to sign for this session.

4. Phone relays the MuSig2 exchange: card INS_NONCE_GEN → pub nonce →
   ASP; ASP returns (a, b, e); card INS_PARTIAL_SIGN → partial; ASP
   partial → aggregate → BIP340 sig. Card's sk never leaves the card;
   phone holds no key material at any point.

5. Phone drives the Boltz submarine swap (on-chain → Lightning) with the
   signed transaction → pays the invoice.

6. Card forgets the session. Done.
```

### Who does what

| Step | Card (client signer) | Phone (dumb terminal) | Arkade ASP / Boltz |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFC transport | responds to APDUs | opens ISO-DEP session | — |
| Key material | client sk, never leaves | **holds none** | ASP sk, never leaves |
| Pubkey / balance | `INS_GET_INDIVIDUAL_PUBKEY` | displays address, fetches VTXO state | ASP serves VTXO state |
| Amount policy | none (blind signing) | enforces "above X → require PIN" | — |
| PIN gate | CTAP2 `clientPin` — card-enforced | sends `pinAuth`, cannot bypass | — |
| Signing | MuSig2 partial `s = k + e·a·sk` (sk never leaves) | relays partials both ways, aggregates + BIP340 verify | ASP partial |
| Lightning | nothing | builds Boltz swap tx, pays invoice | ASP round + Boltz swap |

The card holds the client signing key. The phone holds nothing. The ASP
holds the cosigner key. To sign a transaction you need both the card's
partial AND the ASP's partial — 2-of-2, real self-custody. A compromised
phone cannot steal funds (it has no key and cannot forge the card's
partial). A stolen card cannot steal funds (it has no ASP partial).

### Why this is the realistic path today

The Scenario C path is now wired and has produced a real indexed Ark transaction
from Android NFC. Its current proof stops before the post-broadcast
`send/complete`/Boltz-funded/merchant-settlement sequence; see the incident
report linked at the top. The proven components are:

- ISO-DEP NFC + CTAP2 transport — `mobile/expo-nfc-prf-probe/`
  (Android APK, verified).
- CTAP2 `clientPin` PIN protocol — `scripts/manage-fido2-pin.py` (PC/SC) and
  `mobile/expo-nfc-prf-probe/src/ctapPrf.ts` (NFC PIN-token assertion).
- MuSig2 partial signing — `dist/nuri-musig2-v20-keygen.cap`, on-chain
  proven (Signet tx `c85a73fa…`). The card as *client signer* (Model A)
  uses the exact same protocol as the card as *cosigner* (Model B) — only
  the role changes, not the APDUs.
- Arkade ASP + Boltz swap — wired directly in the Expo probe with
  `@arkade-os/sdk` and `@arkade-os/boltz-swap`. The ASP accepts the physical
  card's client key and verified partial.
- Boltz-swap-ready tx building — `scripts/card-cosign-tweaked.py`,
  `scripts/nuri-card-wallet.mjs` (receive/spend/broadcast over PC/SC).

The remaining proof step is a fresh payment after the monitor-ordering fix:
successful `send/complete`, observed Boltz funded status, and merchant-confirmed
Lightning settlement.

---

## Scenario B — custom Bitcoin POS terminal (the vision)

You walk into a merchant. The merchant has a Bitcoin POS terminal (could be
a phone running our terminal firmware, could be a dedicated device). You tap
your card. The terminal reads the invoice, gets a signature from your card,
pays, and the merchant sees the payment confirmed. You carried only your
card.

This is the debit-card UX. It is also the hardest thing to build, because
no existing Bitcoin POS terminal speaks our APDUs.

### UX flow

```
┌─────────────┐   NFC (ISO-DEP)    ┌──────────────────┐    internet    ┌────────────┐
│   your card │ ←────────────────→ │ merchant POS    │ ←────────────→ │ ASP/Boltz  │
│  (keys)     │                    │ (our firmware)   │                │ /mempool   │
└─────────────┘                    └──────────────────┘                └────────────┘

1. Merchant enters amount on the terminal → terminal generates or fetches
   a Lightning invoice.

2. You tap the card → terminal sends `INS_GET_INDIVIDUAL_PUBKEY` (AID
   4E5552494D554701) → card returns the secp256k1 pubkey.

3. Terminal sends CTAP2 `clientPin` APDU on the FIDO2 AID → you type the
   PIN on the terminal's keypad → card verifies PIN → `pinAuth` established.

4. Terminal sends `INS_NONCE_GEN` then `INS_PARTIAL_SIGN` with the
   BIP341 sighash of the Boltz swap transaction → card returns partial.

5. Terminal aggregates, BIP340-verifies, drives the Boltz swap, broadcasts,
   pays the Lightning invoice, shows "paid".

6. Card forgets everything.
```

### What this requires

1. **A reference terminal implementation.** Open-source software that runs
   on a cheap Android phone (or a Raspberry Pi + NFC HAT) and speaks:
   - ISO-DEP NFC as the reader side,
   - our MuSig2 APDU set (AID `4E5552494D554701`, see below),
   - CTAP2 `clientPin` for the card-side PIN,
   - a Lightning node / Boltz client / Arkade ASP client,
   - a merchant UI (amount, invoice, confirm, paid).
2. **The card-side PIN gate on the MuSig2 applet.** Today the MuSig2 applet
   does not enforce a PIN — `INS_PARTIAL_SIGN` signs whatever it is sent.
   For a terminal flow this must change: the applet should refuse to sign
   until a `pinAuth` has been established in the session. See the security
   model section below.
3. **A published APDU spec** so terminal builders can implement against it.
   The spec already exists in this repo at
   [`docs/musig2-card-extension.md`](musig2-card-extension.md) — it just
   needs the PIN gate added and a "terminal integration" companion doc.

### APDU reference (existing, from `docs/musig2-card-extension.md`)

CLA `0x80`, AID `4E 55 52 49 4D 55 47 32 01` ("NURIMU2\x01"):

| INS | Name | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | GET_VERSION | — | version / build |
| `0x10` | GET_INDIVIDUAL_PUBKEY | key slot | 33-byte compressed pubkey |
| `0x20` | NONCE_GEN | key slot, aggregate x-only pubkey, msg32, session id | 66-byte public nonce |
| `0x30` | PARTIAL_SIGN | key slot, aggregate nonce, signer coefficient context, msg32, session id | 32-byte partial signature |
| `0x40` | RESET_SESSION | session id | — |

For Scenario B, the terminal implements the reader side of this table. The
card side is unchanged from what is already flashed. The only on-card work
needed for Scenario B is the PIN gate (see below).

### Why this is not "tap at any existing Boltcard POS"

Boltcard terminals expect an LNURLW QR / NFC payload — a static URL the
terminal fetches, and a custodian pays on the card's behalf. The card holds
no keys. Our card holds the keys and signs real transactions; that is a
different protocol. A merchant running a Boltcard-only terminal cannot
accept our card. A merchant running our terminal firmware can accept our
card and could also accept Boltcards if the terminal speaks both protocols
— but the card side is not Boltcard-compatible by design, because
Boltcard-compatible means custodial.

---

## Security model — card-side PIN

The single most important property of a debit card is that it refuses to
pay without a PIN the card itself verifies. A PIN the phone checks is
worthless if the phone is compromised; a PIN the card checks is enforced
by the secure element.

### CTAP2 `clientPin` — what is already built

The card already speaks the FIDO2 CTAP2 clientPin protocol. The Python
tool `scripts/manage-fido2-pin.py` proves the full flow over PC/SC:

```bash
npm run card:pin:status    # is a PIN set?
npm run card:pin:set       # set the first PIN (CTAP2 set_pin)
npm run card:pin:change    # change PIN (needs old PIN)
npm run card:pin:verify    # verify PIN → get_pin_token
```

Under the hood (CTAP2 command `0x06`, pinProtocol=1):

| subCommand | name | CBOR map keys |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | `getRetries` | `{1: 1}` |
| `2` | `getKeyAgreementValue` | `{1: 1, 2: 2}` → returns P-256 pubkey at key `1` |
| `3` | `setPin` | `{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: newPinEnc, 4: pinAuth, 5: 2}` |
| `5` | `getPinToken` | `{1: 1, 2: 5, 3: keyAgreement, 4: pinHashEnc}` → returns `pinToken` at key `2` |
| `6` | `changePin` | `{1: 1, 2: 6, 3: newPinEnc, 4: pinAuth, 5: 2, 6: oldPinHashEnc}` |
| `7` | `getPinUvAuthToken` | like `5` but returns a UV token |

The ECDH flow:

```
phone/terminal                                 card
─────────────                                  ────
1. subCommand 2 → getKeyAgreementValue    →   returns card P-256 pubkey
2. phone generates ephemeral P-256 keypair
3. ECDH(ephemeral, card_pub) → sharedPoint
4. sha256(sharedPoint[1:33]) → sharedSecret
5. pinHash = sha256(pin UTF-8)
6. pinHashEnc = AES-CBC-256(sharedSecret, IV=0, pinHash)
7. subCommand 5 {keyAgreement, pinHashEnc} →  card decrypts, compares, returns pinToken
                                               (or increments retry counter on mismatch;
                                                too many mismatches brick the PIN)
```

The mobile NFC implementation now performs the complete protocol-v1 PIN-token
flow over ISO-DEP. Its assertion includes `pinUvAuthParam` and
`pinUvAuthProtocol = 1`; it deliberately does not add `options.uv = true`, which
this card rejected with CTAP status `0x2c`.

### What the PIN protects today vs what it should protect

Today the card-side PIN protects the **FIDO2 path**: a `getAssertion`
with `hmac-secret` (the PRF) refuses to return the PRF without `pinAuth`
once a PIN is set. The MuSig2 applet is a **separate applet** with its own
AID and **no PIN gate at all** — `INS_PARTIAL_SIGN` signs whatever it is
sent. That is the gap.

**What needs to be built on-card:** the MuSig2 applet should refuse
`INS_NONCE_GEN` and `INS_PARTIAL_SIGN` until a `pinAuth` has been presented
in the current session. The cleanest implementation is to share the PIN
token with the FIDO2 applet (the card already has it), or to add a small
`INS_AUTHORIZE` to the MuSig2 applet that takes a `pinAuth` produced by
the FIDO2 clientPin command. Either way the secure element enforces the
PIN — the phone/terminal cannot bypass it.

This is the most important on-card work for the tap-to-pay vision. It is
also the only on-card change required for Scenario B; everything else is
terminal-side software.

### Amount limits

The card signs an opaque 32-byte hash. It cannot see the amount, the
recipient, or the fee. So the card cannot enforce "do not sign more than X
sats" — that has to be a phone/terminal policy.

**But the PIN gate gives us the debit-card equivalent.** The phone/terminal
policy is:

- below threshold X: no PIN prompt, phone just signs and pays (small
  friction, like contactless debit cards below €50),
- above threshold X: phone/terminal must send `clientPin` to the card;
  card refuses to sign without it.

The threshold lives in the phone/terminal, so a compromised phone could lie
about the amount to skip the PIN. That is a real risk. The mitigations are:
(a) the user confirms the amount on the phone screen before the sign,
(b) the card's PIN retry counter limits PIN-guessing attacks, and
(c) for large payments, require the card-side PIN unconditionally
(threshold = 0). The hardware limit — card cannot parse txs — is
permanent; the policy is the best we can do without on-chain tx parsing
on-card, which is a much larger project and not in scope here.

### Biometric unlock

The Feitian BioCARD has a match-on-card fingerprint sensor. Feitian
confirms a Java applet can call the match-on-card fingerprint API to gate a
private-key operation. The SDK is **NDA-gated** — we cannot integrate it
into our own applet without an NDA with Feitian. Until then:

- the FIDO2 applet (Feitian's own, preloaded) can use fingerprint,
- our MuSig2 / ETH applet uses CTAP2 PIN,
- the phone can additionally require FaceID/TouchID before sending the
  sign APDU — phone-enforced, not card-enforced, but good UX.

Long term, the NDA path is the real fingerprint-on-card story.

## Remaining implementation order

The previously planned NFC transport, PIN-token, MuSig2, SDK, ASP, and Boltz
integration steps are implemented. The remaining work is:

1. **Prove the corrected completion order with a fresh real payment.** Require
   `send/complete`, observe Boltz funded status, and confirm merchant Lightning
   settlement. Retain the txid and application logs.

2. **Add regression vectors shared by desktop and Expo.** Feed identical keys,
   nonces, message, and tweak into the Python and pinned scure implementations;
   assert identical `b`, `e`, parity fold, partial verification, and final
   signature.

3. **MuSig2 applet PIN gate (on-card).** `INS_NONCE_GEN` and
   `INS_PARTIAL_SIGN` refuse until a `pinAuth` has been presented in the
   session. This is the single most important on-card change for the
   debit-card UX. Requires the MuSig2 applet source (not currently in
   this repo — only the built CAP is).

4. **Reference POS terminal (Scenario B, vision).** Open-source terminal
   firmware (Android or Raspberry Pi + NFC HAT) that speaks our APDUs,
   CTAP2 PIN, Boltz, and a merchant UI. Research project, not in scope
   for this repo today.

---

## What we cannot do — honest limits

- **Card alone with no internet device anywhere.** The card cannot
  broadcast. No hardware wallet can. The "card alone" UX requires a
  terminal with internet (Scenario B); the "card + your phone" UX
  requires your phone (Scenario C).
- **Card parses the transaction to enforce amount limits.** The card sees
  only a 32-byte hash. Amount limits are a phone/terminal policy, not
  card-enforced. The card-enforced part is the PIN gate.
- **Biometric unlock in our own applet.** Feitian SDK is NDA-gated. Long
  term path. Today: CTAP2 PIN on the card, optionally FaceID/TouchID on
  the phone as a UX layer.
- **Tap at any existing Boltcard POS.** Boltcard terminals expect LNURLW
  (custodial, no keys on card). Our card holds the keys and signs real
  transactions — a different protocol. A merchant needs our terminal
  firmware (Scenario B), or a phone running our app (Scenario C).
- **Browser WebAuthn PRF on macOS/mobile.** Safari returns `prf:null` for
  external security keys; Chrome cannot see a PC/SC contact reader. This
  is why the tap-to-pay path is a **native mobile app**, not a web page.
  The mobile NFC probe (`mobile/expo-nfc-prf-probe/`) is native ISO-DEP
  precisely for this reason.
- **Production-grade side-channel resistance on the on-card bignum.** The
  ETH signer's hand-rolled `modInverse` is variable-time. The MuSig2
  applet uses the card's native EC point math (hardware-hardened) for
  `k·G`, but its scalar arithmetic is Satochip-derived software. For real
  funds, see the [Security model & caveats](../README.md#security-model--caveats--read-this-before-trusting-the-card-with-real-funds)
  section of the main README.

## Provenance

This document is the concept spec for the tap-to-pay north-star described
in the main README's Roadmap track 4. It is honest about the hardware
boundary because pretending otherwise would cost real money later. The
Scenario C pieces are wired in the Expo app through indexed Ark broadcast.
The immediate missing proof is the corrected post-broadcast completion sequence;
Scenario B still needs a standalone reference terminal.
