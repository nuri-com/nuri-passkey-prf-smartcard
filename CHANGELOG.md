## 2026-07-11 — Design-system terminal, profile, and receive claim flow

### Changed

- Rebuilt the Expo terminal with Nuri design-system components only: one
  editable Lightning address prefilled with `smartcard@nuri.com`, a sats amount
  display, the embedded button keypad, and one `Charge` action. Removed the
  nested app-authored card and the merchant/memo form fields.
- Rebuilt payment confirmation around the same keypad, one `Confirm` action,
  design-system card/progress states, human-readable English status messages,
  and clear success/error exits.
- Simplified the profile into a balance-first design-system list. Lightning,
  wallet, and card references are copyable; status, copy confirmation, and
  errors use design-system alerts; each state exposes exactly one primary
  action.

### Fixed

- Receive claims no longer route through outgoing `send/prepare` state. The
  mobile card identity now uses `/api/arkade/receive/claim/approve` and
  approval-token `/arkade/sign` rounds for `claimVHTLC`.
- Claimable incoming payments start automatically after authenticated profile
  sync while retry remains an explicit single-action error state.
- Corrected the local `@nuri/rn` and `@nuri/spec` package paths and added the
  native `expo-clipboard` dependency.

### Verified

- Android Metro export succeeds for the complete app bundle.
- A clean native Android debug build succeeds with JDK 17 and autolinks
  `expo-clipboard`.
- The updated debug APK loads through Metro on a physical Android device.

## 2026-07-11 — Expo profile reads the authenticated Lightning account

### Fixed

- The Expo profile no longer expects `/api/arkade/receive/sync` to return
  `account.username`. The deployed endpoint returns receive arrays but no
  account field, while the desktop bridge separately authenticated
  `/arkade/lnurl/status` and therefore showed `smartcard@nuri.com`.
- Expo now mirrors that proven flow inside one NFC session: read the physical
  MuSig2 key, require the existing `/arkade/info` registration, request an auth
  challenge, produce the PIN-authorized FIDO assertion, and read the registered
  username/address from `/arkade/lnurl/status`.
- The profile origin remains the exact configured credential origin. The live
  server returns a comma-separated origin allowlist, which is validated for
  membership instead of being mistaken for one literal origin.
- Receive sync remains the source of receive rows only. If a future deployment
  also returns an account field, Expo verifies that it matches the separately
  authenticated account and rejects disagreement.

## 2026-07-10 — Expo/web parity incident and live card payment repair

### Fixed

- Removed hardcoded profile identity, balance/list substitutions, merchant
  details, and implicit credential enrollment from the live card profile and
  checkout paths. Card key, username, Lightning address, balance, receive data,
  merchant, memo, and recipient must now come from the inserted card, live
  responses, or visible user input.
- Corrected Android CTAP PIN authorization: protocol-v1 PIN token plus
  `pinUvAuthParam`, without the incompatible `uv: true` option that returned
  status `0x2c`.
- Updated the Expo Nuri send request to the current flat `send/cosign` contract,
  including the required top-level `challenge_token` and assertion fields.
- Deleted the mobile-only `sessionMath.ts` transcript implementation and the
  unused duplicate `cardIdentity.ts` integration. Expo now uses one active
  identity path and one pinned `@scure/btc-signer` 2.2.0 session for
  nonce/challenge scalars, parity folding, both partial verifications,
  aggregation, and final BIP340 verification.
- Started the Boltz funded monitor before Ark broadcast in both Expo and the
  desktop runner, and made `send/complete` and monitor failures fatal instead
  of returning success with a hidden error.

### Proven

- Android NFC completed two card/server MuSig2 rounds with both partials and
  both final aggregate signatures verified.
- Ark transaction
  `965a299bcf8b788eb0ef23896323c4ed97133836e84df19fffcbbcd63a33cc1a`
  is returned by the live Ark indexer.
- This proves card signing, Nuri cosigning, final aggregation, SDK transaction
  construction, and Ark broadcast. A fresh payment is still required to prove
  the final monitor ordering through `send/complete`, Boltz funded status, and
  merchant-confirmed Lightning settlement.

boundary.

## 2026-07-05 (session 2) — ETH signer v1.3: end-to-end ecrecover green

### Fixed
- **ETH applet v1.3: `INS_SIGN` produced wrong signatures (v1.0–v1.2).** The
  signature was a valid ECDSA signature for *some* key Q, but Q ≠ the keygen
  pubkey and Q varied across `sign()` calls (impossible for correct ECDSA where
  Q = d·G must be stable). Root cause: `BigIntegerWrapper.addMod` was not
  aliasing-safe when `result == b` — the prologue `Util.arrayCopy(a, result)`
  clobbered `b` before it was read, so `addMod(z, rd, rd)` computed `2·z`
  instead of `z + rd`. `sign()` and `dbgSignK()` both hit this path
  (`addMod(scratchA, scratchC, scratchC)`), so every signature had wrong `zrd`
  and `s`. Fix: `addMod`/`subMod` now operate index-by-index (read `a[i]` and
  `b[i]` together per byte, write `result[i]` last), so `result` may overlap
  with `a` and/or `b`. `subMod` fixed the same way for robustness (not the
  acute bug, but same latent pattern). Verified end-to-end: `keygen →
  sign(5 hashes) → ecrecover → matches card pubkey` (5/5, v-bit correct,
  low-s enforced). See `docs/gp-macos-troubleshooting.md` "Resolved: INS_SIGN
  produced wrong signatures".

### Diagnosis methodology (documented for future bignum work)
- `dbgKG(k=1)` → exactly G (sanity check on curve parameters).
- `dbgKG(k=random 256-bit)` ×3 → all match host `k·G` (proves the card's
  `generateSecret(k, G)` is correct for production-sized `k`; small `k=2` is
  *not* a valid test — constant-time scalar mult returns a valid but wrong
  point for tiny scalars with 31 leading zero bytes).
- `dbgModInv(a)` ×6, `dbgMulMod(a,b)` ×5 → all match host (isolates the bug
  to the `sign()` composition, not the primitives).
- `dbgSignK(z, k)` (leaks `d`+`k`, debug only) → `r`, `rd`, `kinv` correct;
  `zrd = 2z` instead of `z+rd` → pins the aliasing bug. This INS **must be
  removed before production** (d-leak).

## 2026-07-05 — ETH signer on-card; gp post-mortem; SIGN infinite-loop fix

### Added
- **`card/eth/`** (`NuriEcdsaSigner.java` + Satochip bignum classes) +
  **`dist/nuri-eth-signer.cap`**: secp256k1 ECDSA signer applet for
  Ethereum/EVM — key generated on-card, signs 32-byte hashes, returns
  `r(32)‖s(32)‖v(1)` with EIP-2 low-s. AID `4E55524945544801` ("NURIETH1").
  Spec: `docs/eth-signing-spec.md`; host test: `scripts/card-eth-test.py`.
- **`docs/gp-macos-troubleshooting.md`**: full post-mortem of a lost day —
  "gp can't find the reader" was a broken gp *snapshot* build (jnasmartcardio
  card-present detection); release v26.06.04 worked first try. Plus the macOS
  PC/SC wedge pattern (stalled APDU → system-wide `SCardConnect` hang → re-seat
  the card) and the OMNIKEY 5422 T=0 requirement.

### Fixed
- **ETH applet v1.1: `INS_SIGN` hung the card forever (v1.0).** Three bugs in
  the software `modInverse` (binary extended GCD): guaranteed infinite loop
  (`u` hits 0, `while(isEven(u))` spins on zero; termination waited for `v==0`
  which is unreachable), parity checked on the big-endian MSB instead of the
  LSB, and odd-value halving computed `(x+n) mod n` (a no-op) instead of the
  257-bit integer `(x+n)/2`. New loop terminates on `u==1 || v==1`, halves via
  `add_carry` with the carry re-inserted, reduces the result into `[0,n)`, and
  the iteration cap now throws `6988` instead of never firing. Verified
  off-card against `pow(a,-1,n)` (5000+ cases) before flashing.
- `scripts/card-eth-test.py`: force **T=0** (OMNIKEY 5422 contact slot fails
  T=1 transmits with `0x80100016`).

### Changed
- `~/bin/gp.jar` (dev machine): snapshot `f2af9ef` → **release v26.06.04**
  (backup kept as `gp.jar.f2af9ef.bak`). Rule: only gp release jars.

## 2026-06-30 — Card-as-wallet (browser + reader), FIDO2 user-presence, hardware findings

### Added
- **`web/card-wallet.html`** + server `POST /api/wallet/{address,utxos,spend}`:
  card-does-both wallet — client key = card FIDO2 PRF → `HKDF(app:nuri.com|wallet|v1)`
  → BIP86 `m/86'/0'/0'/0/0`; cosigner = card MuSig2 applet;
  `musig2(client,card)` + `CSV(52500)`. Reader path proven end-to-end on **mainnet**;
  browser path falls back to the reader (this card can't do browser WebAuthn PRF).
- **`web/passkey-wallet.html`** + `POST /api/cosign/passkey-sign`: localhost passkey
  → valid card-cosigned BIP340 signature demo.
- **`patches/0002-advertise-user-presence.patch`** + **`dist/FIDO2-up.cap`**: FIDO2
  applet advertises CTAP2 `up:true` so browsers/macOS accept the card as a passkey
  (the applet already set `UP=1` in every assertion). v1 `dist/FIDO2.cap` preserved.
- **`docs/fido2-user-presence.md`**, **`docs/logbook.md`**, this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed
- `scripts/nuri-card-wallet.mjs`: optional `clientSeedHex` (browser/reader PRF) +
  a key-ownership safety check that refuses to sign a spend unless the passkey/card
  owns the funded address.

### Findings (hardware / platform)
- **secp256k1 / MuSig2 needs card OS `2025-05-14`** (ATR `3b:81:80:01:80:80`). The
  `2023-03-30` OS lacks the EC point-multiply (`ALG_EC_SVDP_DH_PLAIN_XY`) → keygen
  returns `6A81`. Card OS is mask-ROM, not user-updatable. Screen with `gp -i`
  (OS date); confirm with `cosign:real-card:keygen`.
- **macOS Safari does not expose WebAuthn PRF for external security keys** — the
  card enables `hmac-secret` (assertion ED flag true) but Safari returns `prf:null`;
  Chrome can't see a PC/SC contact reader. Browser PRF works only via native-NFC
  app or Windows. `up:true` fix confirmed working on hardware regardless.
